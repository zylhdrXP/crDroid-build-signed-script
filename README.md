# AfterlifeOS-build-signed-script
Script for creating a signing build environment

## Disclaimer
This script only works for password-less keys (DO NOT SET A PASSWORD)  
*This is due to building inline, other steps are necessary for a password*

*Works with crDroid 8.x+ or lineage19.1+*

## How to run
Download the script in your root build directory and run it

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zylhdrXP/crDroid-build-signed-script/refs/heads/afl/create-signed-env.sh
chmod +x create-signed-env.sh
./create-signed-env.sh
```
Build as usual!
